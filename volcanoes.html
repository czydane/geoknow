Mayon is the archetype of a symmetrical stratovolcano and one of the world most active ones. It has frequent eruptions producing pyroclastic flows, mud flows and ash falls that repeatedly triggered large-scale evacuations. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1200 people and devastated several towns. The volcano rises 2462 m above the Albay Gulf and has very steep upper slopes averaging 35-40 degrees capped by a small summit crater. Historical records of eruptions date back to 1616 and range from strombolian to basaltic plinian, with cyclical activity beginning with basaltic eruptions, followed by longer term andesitic lava flows.</div>

All historic eruptions took place from the 5-km-wide volcanic island in the northern-central part of the lake. The island is formed by overlapping stratovolcanoes, cinder cones and tuff rings (maars). Historic eruptions have seen the constant change and growth of the island. 
Taal caused one of the worst volcano disasters in history: its eruption in 1911 killed 1334 people and caused ash fall as far as Manila city.</div>

Musuan last erupted in Dec 1886, as a Jesuit priest reported who visited the volcano 4 years later in 1891, at which time there was still strong fumarolic activity, which prevented closer examination. The eruption was probably phreatic in nature, and was reported to have "burned everything around it".
